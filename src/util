log() {
    # The 'log()' function handles the printing of information.
    # In 'haikufetch' (and 'neofetch'!) the printing of the ascii art and info
    # happen independently of each other.
    #
    # The size of the ascii art is stored and the ascii is printed first.
    # Once the ascii is printed, the cursor is located right below the art
    # (See marker $[1]).
    #
    # Using the stored ascii size, the cursor is then moved to marker $[2].
    # This is simply a cursor up escape sequence using the "height" of the
    # ascii art.
    #
    # 'log()' then moves the cursor to the right the "width" of the ascii art
    # with an additional amount of padding to add a gap between the art and
    # the information (See marker $[3]).
    #
    # When 'log()' has executed, the cursor is then located at marker $[4].
    # When 'log()' is run a second time, the next line of information is
    # printed, moving the cursor to marker $[5].
    #
    # Markers $[4] and $[5] repeat all the way down through the ascii art
    # until there is no more information left to print.
    #
    # Every time 'log()' is called the script keeps track of how many lines
    # were printed. When printing is complete the cursor is then manually
    # placed below the information and the art according to the "heights"
    # of both.
    #
    # The math is simple: move cursor down $((ascii_height - info_height)).
    # If the aim is to move the cursor from marker $[5] to marker $[6],
    # plus the ascii height is 8 while the info height is 2 it'd be a move
    # of 6 lines downwards.
    #
    # However, if the information printed is "taller" (takes up more lines)
    # than the ascii art, the cursor isn't moved at all!
    #
    # Once the cursor is at marker $[6], the script exits. This is the gist
    # of how this "dynamic" printing and layout works.
    #
    # This method allows ascii art to be stored without markers for info
    # and it allows for easy swapping of info order and amount.
